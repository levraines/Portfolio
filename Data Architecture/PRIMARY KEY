-- Primary Key Constraint

-- Another difference between a unique and primary key constraint is that there can only be one 
-- primary key constraint per table: this primary key constraint is going to identify the column or 
-- set of columns that will be the "official" database identifier for rows in that table.

CREATE TABLE "users" (
"id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
"username" VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

ALTER TABLE "users" ADD UNIQUE ("id");

-- While a SERIAL type of column can automatically generate incrementing integer values, 
-- only defining a column as SERIAL doesn't guarantee uniqueness of the values, since values can be specified manually. Adding a 
-- UNIQUE constraint could be thought of as being sufficient, but that would allow NULL values.

CREATE TABLE "users"(
"id" SERIAL,
"username" VARCHR (20),
PRIMARY KEY ("id"),
UNIQUE ("username")
);


-- Another way

CREATE TABLE "users"(
"id" SERIAL,
"usermame" VARCHAR,
CONSTRAINT "users_pk" PRIMARY KEY ("id"),
CONSTRAINT "unique_usernames" UNIQUE ("username")
);
