-- FOREIGH KEY

ALTER TABLE "comments"
    ADD FOREIGH KEY ("user_id") REFERENCES "users" ("id");
    
ALTER TABLE "comments"
    ADD FOREIGH KEY ("user_id") REFERENCES "users"; -- both examples work.
    

-- We can add foreign key constraints while creating a table, either by adding a REFERENCES clause with the column definition, or by adding a 
-- CONSTRAINT â€¦ FOREIGN KEY clause along with all the column definitions.

FOREIGN KEY "referencing_column" 
REFERENCES "referenced_table" ("referenced_column");

-- If we omit the ("referenced_column") part of the foreign key definition, then it will be implied that 
-- we are referencing the primary key of the referenced table. 
-- this is one more thing that makes primary key constraints special compared to unique constraints.
