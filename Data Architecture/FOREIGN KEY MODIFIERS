-- FK Constraints: Modifiers

-- Adding ON DELETE CASCADE to a foreign key constraint will have the effect that when the referenced data gets 
-- deleted, the referencing rows of data will be automatically deleted as well.

-- Adding ON DELETE SET NULL to a foreign key constraint will have the effect that when the referenced
-- data gets deleted, the referring column will have its value set to NULL. Since NULL is a special value, it 
-- won't break the foreign key constraint because it will be clear that that row of data is now referencing absolutely nothing.

-- Given a table books with id, title, and author_id which references the id column of another table called authors, 
-- what is the proper syntax to add a foreign key constraint that will make sure that all books belonging to an author 
-- get deleted if the author gets deleted?

ALTER TABLE "books" ADD
FOREIGN KEY ("author_id")
REFERENCES "authors" ("id") ON DELETE CASCADE;
