-- Exercise Instructions

/*
For this exercise, you're going to add some foreign key constraints to an existing schema, but you'll have to respect some business rules that were put in place:

As a first step, please explore the currently provided schema and understand the relationships between all the tables
Once that's done, please create all the foreign key constraints that are necessary to keep the referential integrity of the schema, with the following in mind:
When an employee who's a manager gets deleted from the system, we want to keep all the employees that were under him/her. They simply won't have a manager assigned to them.
We can't delete an employee as long as they have projects assigned to them
When a project gets deleted from the system, we won't need to keep track of the people who were working on it.
/*

ALTER TABLE "employees"
  ADD CONSTRAINT "valid_manager"
  FOREIGN KEY ("manager_id") REFERENCES "employees" ("id") ON DELETE SET NULL;

ALTER TABLE "employee_projects"
  ADD CONSTRAINT "valid_employee"
  FOREIGN KEY ("employee_id") REFERENCES "employees" ("id");

ALTER TABLE "employee_projects"
  ADD CONSTRAINT "valid_project"
  FOREIGN KEY ("project_id") REFERENCES "projects" ("id") ON DELETE CASCADE;
