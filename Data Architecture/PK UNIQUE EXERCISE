-- Exercise Instructions
-- For this exercise, you're going to have to explore the data schema in
-- the Postgres workspace in order to determine which pieces of data require Unique 
-- and Primary Key constraints. Then, you'll have to execute the appropriate ALTER TABLE 
-- statements to add these constraints to the data set.

-- Hint: There are 6 total constraints to be added.

ALTER TABLE "books" ADD PRIMARY KEY ("id");

ALTER TABLE "books" ADD UNIQUE ("isbn");

ALTER TABLE "authors" ADD PRIMARY KEY ("id");

ALTER TABLE "authors" ADD UNIQUE ("email_address");

ALTER TABLE "book_authors" ADD PRIMARY KEY ("book_id", "author_id");

ALTER TABLE "book_authors" ADD UNIQUE ("book_id", "contribution_rank");
