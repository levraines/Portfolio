-- UNIQUE CONSTRAINTS

-- A unique constraint is a type of rule that you can add to a database table to ensure that a column or set of columns 
-- are unique across all the rows of the table. 
-- A common use-case for that is ensuring that no two users of your system can register with the same username.

CREATE TABLE "users"(
"id" SERIAL,
"username" VARCHAR,
UNIQUE ("username")
);


CREATE TABLE "leaderboards"(
"game_id" INTEGER, 
"player_id" INTEGER, 
"rank" SMALLINT,
UNIQUE("game_id", "rank")
);

-- Unique constraints can target multiple columns. In that case, it's the combination of columns that has to be unique across the table.
-- So for every game id, needs to be an unique rank. 

-- What is the correct syntax for making the users table username column unique while giving it a custom name?

ALTER TABLE "users" ADD CONSTRAINT
"unique_usernames" UNIQUE ("username");
