-- CHECK CONSTRAINTS

-- CHECK constraints allow us to implement custom business rules at the level of the database. Examples of such rules would be: 
-- "a product can't have a negative quantity" or "the discount price should always be less than the regular price".

ALTER TABLE "items"
ADD CONSTRAINT "non_negative_quantity" CHECK ("quantity" > 0);

-- A CHECK constraint can be added either after a table was created, or during table creation. 
-- Like all other constraints, it can be added along with the column definition, or along with all the column definitions.

-- The general syntax of the constraint is: CHECK (some expression that returns true or false). 
-- The expression can target one column, multiple columns, and use any Postgres functions to do its checking.

ALTER TABLE "items" ADD CONSTRAINT "item_must_have_name"
CHECK(LENGTH(TRIM("name")) > 0);
