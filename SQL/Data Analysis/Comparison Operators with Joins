-- Inequality operators (a.k.a. comparison operators) don't only need to be 
-- date times or numbers, they also work on strings! You'll see how this works by 
-- completing the following quiz, which will also reinforce the concept of joining with comparison operators.

-- In the following SQL Explorer, write a query that left joins the accounts table and the sales_reps tables on each sale 
-- rep's ID number and joins it using the < comparison operator on accounts.primary_poc and sales_reps.name, like so:

-- accounts.primary_poc < sales_reps.name

-- The query results should be a table with three columns: the account name (e.g. Johnson Controls), 
-- the primary contact name (e.g. Cammy Sosnowski), and the
--  sales representative's name (e.g. Samuel Racine). Then answer the subsequent multiple choice question.

SELECT a.name, a.primary_poc, s.name
FROM accounts AS a
LEFT JOIN sales_reps AS s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
AND a.primary_poc < s.name;
