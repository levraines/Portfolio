-- Practice Question Using WHERE with Non-Numeric Data
-- Filter the accounts table to include the company name, website, and the 
-- primary point of contact (primary_poc) just for the Exxon Mobil company in the accounts table.account_id

SELECT 
name, website, primary_poc
FROM accounts
WHERE name = 'Exxon Mobil';


-- recordar que SQL trabaja con single quotes no don double quotes.
